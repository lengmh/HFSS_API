% CREATE_IMD M-file for create_imd.fig
%      CREATE_IMD, by itself, creates a new CREATE_IMD or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = CREATE_IMD returns the handle to a new CREATE_IMD or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      CREATE_IMD('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in CREATE_IMD.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      CREATE_IMD('Property','Value',...) creates a new CREATE_IMD or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before create_imd_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to create_imd_OpeningFcn via varargin.

%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
